# Project 01 - Brainster Labs

## Project Overview

**Brainster Labs** marks the beginning of my project series, crafted as a simple yet interactive webpage during Brainster's Full-Stack Academy. This project focuses on displaying dynamic cards, enabling filtering, and handling form creation to streamline frontend practice. It showcases foundational skills in building responsive and user-friendly interfaces, featuring:

- **HTML** for structured content layout.
- **CSS** and **SCSS** for enhanced styling and modular design.
- **Bootstrap** for a responsive and modern UI framework.
- **JavaScript** for interactive features like auto-typed text in the hero banner, card filtering by academy categories, and form validation.
