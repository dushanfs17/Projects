# Project 03: Admin Panel - Cyberware Global Defence

An Admin Panel application was developed using Laravel to efficiently manage various aspects of a website's content. The panel offers comprehensive CRUD functionality for job postings, team members, partners, services, industries, and service categories. It also features an API endpoint to handle contact form submissions, send automatic replies to users, and display message previews on the dashboard. User authentication is seamlessly implemented with Laravel Breeze, ensuring role-based access. The dashboard provides insights into job statistics and real-time message previews.

### This project leverages:

- **Laravel** for robust backend development and API functionality.
- **MySQL** for efficient database management and relationships.
- **Tailwind CSS** for an intuitive and responsive user interface.

#### Sincerely,

#### Dushan Hadji-Vasilev
